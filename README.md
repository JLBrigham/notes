# Group project - Notes

A single page front end vanilla javascript app for note taking.

### Project challenges

* To create a web app that only uses a single page.
* To do so without using any external libraries, such as jQuery or Jasmine.
* To develop the app in a TDD way.

### User stories

```
As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want
```
```
As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember
```
```
As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note
```
```
As a programmer
I can use shortcodes like `:fire:` that get converted into emojis like ğŸ”¥
So I can record notes with fun little pictures
```

## How to use

* We can put how to use the app when we've finished it here!

## Tests

* The javascript folder is divided into src and spec folders. 
* To run the tests, open tests.html from the javascript folder in your browser. This loads and runs both the src and spec files.
* Open the console to view pass and fail messages for the tests.
